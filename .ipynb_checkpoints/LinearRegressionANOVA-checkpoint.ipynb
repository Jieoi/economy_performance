    "\n",
    "Year\n",
    ": The interaction between Year and Country (F = 3.06, p = 0.060) indicates that the change in net trade over time may differ between countries. While the p-value is slightly above 0.05, it suggests that there might be a trend worth exploring further.\n",

    "Overall, this ANCOVA shows that both the country and the net financial account are significant predictors of net trade, while the influence of R&D expenditure and its interaction with countries does not appear to be statistically significant.
